In recent years, acts of assault and violence against women
are rising at a menacing rate.There is thus, a need of simpler
safety solution that can be activated as simply as by pressing
a switch and can instantly send out alerts to the near ones
of the victim and give mere shock to the attacker to push

him away. The aim of proposed system is to introduce
an IoT device which provides solution to the victims in
such conditions providing features like mere shock to the
attacker and sending SOS messages of current location
indicating emergency to Police stations and her relatives
in order to avoid any misfortunes.
